<h1>Skill Set<h1>

  <h2>Programming languages</h2>

<pre> 	 	 
C	15 years	I updated and maintained homegrown messaging middleware solution which supports 12 different operating systems, 120 applications and 350K messages. I wrote a driver to control tape a drive to process thousands of files daily for the Fedex data ingestion software.
C++	12 years	I added four major features to credit card processing (back-end) servers. These servers process massive transaction files. One major feature was the airline ticket processing for PayPal.
Python	7 years	I wrote a command line utility to drive the in-house deployment system, and used it to drive the end-to-end tests. The deployment system deployed 50 to 120 packages to >10K machines. Triage and fix bugs for a mobile security system that involved messaging and middleware systems, monitoring tools, and REST services.
GO	2 years	I worked on a barcode service, globally distributed and highly available, as well as the deployment and test infrastructure for said service.
C#	2 years	I implemented a set of C# microservices (Azure Functions) around a graph database. This system models processes, assets, teams, and their complex relationships.
Rust	Learning	Self-taught, online training classes.
